## Contribution Summary – Ali (Person A)

I was assigned responsibility for the UI design and built the homepage, user/student registration form page, Admin Dashboard, Admin – User Management page, Admin – Pending Accounts page, and Admin – All Accounts page using custom JSP, HTML, CSS, and Java Servlet code. I implemented the complete student registration workflow, including QC ID front and back image uploads, and developed temporary backend logic using hard-coded functions so the system runs smoothly without a database. The coach section was removed, and the separate register JSP was eliminated so that clicking “Create New Account” now directly opens the student registration page. All pages are fully connected through complete navigation, and the code structure is prepared for future MySQL and AWS integration.

Here is my source code uploaded to Google Drive for teammates to access a clean version without issues from GitHub clutter:

And, I created the Use Case Diagram and the System Architecture Diagram, clearly documenting system functionality and overall structure to support team development and presentation.

As part of the requirement discovery process, short interviews were conducted with users and administrators to understand system expectations and usability needs. Their feedback helped define account management features and core workout tracking functionalities.
