Contribution Summary – Ali (Person A)

I was assigned responsibility for the UI design and built the homepage, user/student registration form page, Admin Dashboard, Admin 
– User Management page, Admin – Pending Accounts page, and Admin – All Accounts page using custom JSP, HTML, CSS, and Java Servlet code. 
I implemented the complete student registration workflow, including QC ID front and back image uploads, and
developed temporary backend logic using hard-coded functions so the system runs smoothly without a database. 
The Coach section was removed, and the separate register JSP was eliminated so that clicking “Create New Account” now directly opens 
the student registration page. 
All pages are fully connected through complete navigation.

I also created the Use Case Diagram and the System Architecture Diagram, clearly documenting system functionality
and overall structure to support team development and presentation.

As part of the requirement discovery process, short interviews were conducted with users and administrators to understand system expectations 
and usability needs. Their feedback helped define account management features and core workout tracking functionalities.

Took live UI screenshots based on Thasneema’s updated User and Admin dashboard code and uploaded them to GitHub.
