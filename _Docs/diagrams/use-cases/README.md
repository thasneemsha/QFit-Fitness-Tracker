# Use Case Diagrams – QFit Universal Workout Tracker

The QFit system use cases are represented across multiple UML diagrams to
maintain clarity and correctness as system scope increased.

The refined use case diagrams are located in:
`Docs/diagrams/use-cases/`

These diagrams separate concerns by actor and responsibility:
- User Account & Workout Management
- Administrative Management
- External Fitness Platform Integration

All diagrams share the same system boundary and together represent the
complete use case model.
