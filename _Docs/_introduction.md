# Introduction


## 1. Overview

The **QFit Gym Tracker Web Application** is a fitness tracking platform designed for Queens College students. The system enables users to log workouts, track fitness progress, and access exercise information retrieved from [need to include which one we use] APIs. The application uses Java Servlets and a custom MySQL relational database for backend processing, while JSON is used for data exchange between the client and server. The front end is built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure full compatibility with the servlet-based structure.


## 2. Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:


- Provide Queens College students with a **free and simple workout-tracking system**.  

- Integrate **external free APIs** (such as .....) to supply real-time exercise and health information.  

- Use **JSON** to structure and display data, demonstrating modern web-development practices.  

- Allow users to **log workouts**, store them in a custom database, and retrieve their history in JSON format.  

- Build a secure, efficient, and maintainable system using Java Servlets and professional software engineering principles.  

- Deliver clear, organized documentation that supports collaboration and future extension.


## 3. Scope of the Project

This project includes the following components:


- Student login and authentication  

- Workout logging (exercise, sets, reps, weight)  

- Database storage of all workout entries  

- JSON-based workout history retrieval  

- Integration with these **API** :  

    [example place holder]

  - **ExerciseDB API** – provides exercise names, muscle groups, and instructions  

  - **API Ninjas Nutrition API** – provides calorie and nutrition information  

  - **Health/fitness APIs** that return data in JSON format  

- Simple, browser-accessible frontend built with HTML/CSS/JS  

- Servlet-based backend responsible for processing forms, storing data, and returning JSON



## 4. Background Information

This project was created for a software engineering course at Queens College. Thus making the Queens college student the main target audience. This tracker is **free for all QC students** and focus on **API usage**, **JSON**, and **fitness tracking**. As a result, the project emphasizes clean architecture, clear data flow, external API integration, and a lightweight front-end that communicates with Java Servlets through JSON.
